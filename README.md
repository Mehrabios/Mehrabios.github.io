## My projects

### StyleWave Library
**In development**<br><br>
StyleWave is a free open source library for CSS and JavaScript that you can use to develop your projects. Using StyleWave can make the development of your projects faster and easier.<br> With StyleWave, you can use a large number of ready-made styles and animations in CSS by entering the className in HTML, and there is no need to go to css and enter styles for some elements.
